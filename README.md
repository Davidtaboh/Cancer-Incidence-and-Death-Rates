# Cancer Incidence and Death Rates

This project examines the relationship between cancer incidence and death rates, and statistics that were measured on a state level. These include median
household income, percentage of workers who work in manufacturing, pollution, and health insurance coverage.

To run our analysis, we made numerous scatterplots and other visualizations that compared the cancer data against the various state-level statistics. For most of our visualizations, we also ran scripts to determine the Pearson correlation coefficient. This coefficient is a measure of correlation, with 0 being the least and 1 being the most.
This allowed us to see if there was a correlation between the cancer data and the state-level statistics, and further measure how much it is.
